## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I can proudly say that this is my first Frontend Mentor's Challenge completed. Theare many learnings I've got through this developing process.

One example of my the code that makes me feel proud is the following:

```css
.seccion-redes-sociales button:hover{
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    cursor: pointer;
    font-weight: 700;
 } 
```
### Continued development

In future projects I will try my best to practice on how to use Flexbox as well CSS Grid. I consider that these two models of stylizing are very useful when trying to create a css design with pure css.
